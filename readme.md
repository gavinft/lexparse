# lexparse

Small recursive descent parser and lexer project I'm currently working on. Not sure how far I'll go
with it, but the plan is that it could be used for game scripting and would have specific language
portions for things like game objects or components.

## Usage

Change the hardcoded string in `main.rs` and then `cargo run`.
